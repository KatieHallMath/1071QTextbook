<p>Throughout <em class="emphasis">Calculus Volume 1</em> you will find examples and exercises that present classical ideas and techniques as well as modern applications and methods. Derivations and explanations are based on years of classroom experience on the part of long-time calculus professors, striving for a balance of clarity and rigor that has proven successful with their students. Motivational applications cover important topics in probability, biology, ecology, business, and economics, as well as areas of physics, chemistry, engineering, and computer science. <em class="emphasis">Student Projects</em> in each chapter give students opportunities to explore interesting sidelights in pure and applied mathematics, from determining a safe distance between the grandstand and the track at a Formula One racetrack, to calculating the center of mass of the Grand Canyon Skywalk or the terminal speed of a skydiver. <em class="emphasis">Chapter Opening Applications</em> pose problems that are solved later in the chapter, using the ideas covered in that chapter. Problems include the hydraulic force against the Hoover Dam, and the comparison of relative intensity of two earthquakes. <em class="emphasis">Definitions, Rules,</em> and <em class="emphasis">Theorems</em> are highlighted throughout the text, including over 60 <em class="emphasis">Proofs</em> of theorems.</p>
