<p>We have studied the general characteristics of functions, so now let's examine some specific classes of functions. In Part A. we began by reviewing the basic properties of linear fucntions. Now we look at quadratic functions, and then generalize to include higher-degree polynomials. By combining root functions with polynomials, we can define general algebraic functions and distinguish them from the transcendental functions we examine later in this chapter. We finish the section with examples of piecewise-defined functions and take a look at how to sketch the graph of a function that has been shifted, stretched, or reflected from its initial form. Note: This is the second half of section 1.2 in the original form of OpenStax Calculus.</p>
